[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  this phrase in my first book, every big opportunity starts with a little conversation. And there's
[00:04.800 --> 00:11.280]  quite a lot going on in there. What you get, and which I so wish so many other people would get,
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.640]  is that the networking event is the start of the conversation. So many people trying to get the
[00:16.640 --> 00:22.080]  beginning and the end of the conversation all into a two hour networking event. I need to meet
[00:22.080 --> 00:25.760]  this guy, I need to tell him all about my business, I need to work out whether he wants to work with
[00:25.760 --> 00:32.560]  me. Just chill, just find out about the other people. Really importantly, when you come away
[00:32.560 --> 00:39.840]  from networking events with a load of business cards, this is why I've got the camera focused here
[00:39.840 --> 00:45.200]  and not down there. Come away from events with a load of business cards. That's when the real
[00:45.200 --> 00:50.640]  networking happens. You connect with people, find out about them at the event, just chat to them.
[00:50.640 --> 00:56.240]  It's after the event that you can put in the actual working really connecting with people.
